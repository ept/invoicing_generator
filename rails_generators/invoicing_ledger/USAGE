Description:
    Generates several model classes, a database migration, a controller and a
    few views in a Rails project, constituting the core structure you need in
    order to make use of the invoicing gem in your application.
    
    Once you have this structure in place you can start creating your own
    Invoice and LineItem subclasses and store them in the database; the
    generated controller/views will pick these up and present them nicely
    out of the box.
    
    You can use the option flags to configure which fields you would like to
    include in your database tables.
  
    After running this generator you should take a look at the generated
    controller and model classes and search for occurrences of 'FIXME', since
    a few manual tweaks will be required to integrate the generated code into
    your project.

Examples:
    `./script/generate invoicing_ledger billing --currency=GBP`
